## 1x1
An Apps Script to track learning outcomes based on the idea of one tab per student (1x1), with some functions to keep grading relatively agile. You have a student tab for summaries, but you are not required to use it â€” although you can if you want.

You can find an example Google Sheets file with the script at this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1errDB-Z7PrpbQ5q_YqlvlbNPhVpoRzp6Lea3XmVI0-M/copy).
